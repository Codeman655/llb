# Lethal League Blaze Angle Tool

For exploring character angles and intersections. Mostly JavaScript and utilizes [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).

## Notes

* Angles were taken from [Daiotzu's angle guide](https://imgur.com/a/OftNrZ8)
* These angles are stored in characters.json, please note that some of the signs are changed due to the way paper.js angles are set up.
* Exact stage pixel dimensions were unknown, so this is simply eye-balled from the stage screenshot.

## Todo

Adding more stages.
